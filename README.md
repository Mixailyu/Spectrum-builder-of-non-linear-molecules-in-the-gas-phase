# Spectrum-builder-of-non-linear-molecules-in-the-gas-phase
This program is for experimental and theoretical physicists.
The program interface is implemented in Russian.
The program builds a spectrum of non-linear polyatomic molecules.
To construct the spectrum, the values of the anharmonic force constants and harmonic frequencies are needed.

Examples: O3.py, SO2.py files

The program is launched by the start.py script
